Epoch Variable:
The epoch variables of each file appear to be fairly good. They seem have 
at least 1 second accuracy at this point, but still need through testing and
some improvement. 
One area where epoch will be off is if the frame counter rolls over (whether 
due to DPU reset or actual frame number roll over). 

Frame Counter Rollover;
When the frame counter reaches 2^21 it will rollover. This will through off
any mod40 data and epoch calculation. 

Spectra:
The channel to energy level conversion seems to be off. Currently this is only
done with temperature corrections. In the future this will be done with 511 
line fitting and/or other methods.

Magnetic Coordinates:
It seems like there are a very large number of bad values in the magnetic
coordinate file. This needs to be investigated.

CMD_CNT:
Bitmask used to pull out CMD_CNT info is wrong. MSB should be ignored to get
the correct value.

MIN_ALT:
Any altitude value below 5km will get a fill value regardless of min_alt command
line argument.

GPS_TIME Fill Values:
The array was not being initialized with fill values so gaps often show up as 0.

Housekeeping Meta-Data:
Some of the housekeeping values have a minimum allowed value set to 0 even 
though that variable may go negative. This will prevent out of range points 
from being displayed in Autoplot.
