Epoch Variable:
The epoch variables of each file appear to be fairly good. They seem have 
at least 1 second accuracy at this point, but still need through testing and
some improvement. 

Spectra:
The energy calibration is done simply by finding the 511 line and scaling the 
data. This process will be refined in the future.

Housekeeping Meta-Data:
Some of the housekeeping values have a minimum allowed value set to 0 even 
though that variable may go negative. This will prevent out of range points 
from being displayed in Autoplot.
