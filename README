barrel-cdf-generator
====================

The BARREL CDF Generator is meant to run daily to produce L1 and L2 BARREL CDF 
Files. 

syntax:
java -jar cdf_gen.jar ini=XXXX date=YYMMDD [L=LL] [min_alt=KM]

YYMMDD is the day of data to process.

XXXX lists the location of an ini file that contains server information and list
of payloads to process.

LL is a list of comma delimited CDF levels to produce (e.g. L=1,2). L0 (Day-long
telemetry files) are created regardless of this setting.

KM is the minimum altitude to include in the CDFs. Default is 5km.

All command line arguments can be listed in in the ini file (with the exeption
of the ini= argument of course). Ini file listings take precedence over command
line arguments.

A description of the data format for the output files is located in the docs/ 
directory.
